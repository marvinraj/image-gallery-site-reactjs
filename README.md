## My thought processes as I work on this project
1. how do i want this site to look like? ui inspo?
    - searched online and found pinterest and another yt vid for inspo.
2. now how do i divide the ui into components?
    - researched and found an article written by Emmanuel Fordjour Kumah.
3. ok now time to create each components' file and work on it one by one.  
4. started working on navbar and i already got stuck. how do i center a div? HAHAHAH

5. now i cant seem to work my head around flex (which i thought i knew). "justify-content: center;
  flex-direction: column;" --> this does not work together, why?
